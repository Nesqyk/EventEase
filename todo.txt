TODO for TMR:

Finish Client Features, 

Add another feature/s for clients. 
A calendar which highlights which day is an event; like it will have a color which day 
a specific day will commence.

The real question is; what problem do you really want to solve?


Additional for the calendar: add a highlight to a 
specific day for which an event will commence.

For the dashboard: maybe add a section whereby it'll show list
of upcoming events? -> replace the calendar with it.
